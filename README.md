[GraphQL Hive](https://graphql-hive.com/) provides all the tools to get
visibility of your GraphQL architecture at all stages, from standalone APIs to
composed schemas (Federation, Stitching):

- **Schema Registry** with custom breaking changes detection
- **Monitoring** of RPM, latency, error rate, and more
- **Integrations** with your favorite tools (Slack, Github Actions, and more)

---

## Getting started

### Get your Hive token

Please refer to the Hive documentation: <https://docs.graphql-hive.com/features/tokens>.

### Install the `grahql-hive` gem

```sh
gem install graphql-hive
```

**2. Configure `GraphQL::Hive` in your Schema**

Add `GraphQL::Hive` **at the end** of your schema definition:

```ruby
class Schema < GraphQL::Schema
  query QueryType

  use(GraphQL::Hive, { token: '<YOUR_TOKEN>' })
end
```

The `reporting` configuration is required to push your GraphQL Schema to the Hive registry.
Doing so will help better detect breaking changes and more upcoming features.
If you only want to use the operations monitoring, replace the `reporting` option with the following `report_schema: false`.

### (Optional) Configure Life-cycle Hooks

Calling these hooks are situational - it's likely that you may not need to call
them at all!

`on_start`

Call this hook if you are running `GraphQL::Hive` in a process that `fork`s
itself.

Example: `puma` web server running in (["clustered
mode"](https://github.com/puma/puma/tree/6d8b728b42a61bcf3c1e4c698c9165a45e6071e8#clustered-mode))

```ruby
# config/puma.rb
preload_app!

on_worker_boot do
  GraphQL::Hive.instance.on_start
end
```

`on_exit`

If your GraphQL API process is shut down non-gracefully but has a shutdown hook
to call into, call `on_worker_exit`.

`puma` example:

```ruby
# config/puma.rb

on_worker_shutdown do
  GraphQL::Hive.instance.on_exit
end
```

You are all set! ðŸš€

Then deploying or starting up your GraphQL API, `graphql-hive` will immediately:

- publish the schema to the Hive registry
- forward the operations metrics to Hive

### See how your GraphQL API is operating

You should now see operations information (RPM, error rate, queries performed) on your [GraphQL Hive dashboard](https://app.graphql-hive.com/):

### Going further: use the Hive GitHub app

Stay on top of your GraphQL Schema changes by installing the Hive GitHub Application and enabling Slack notifications about breaking changes:
